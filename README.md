## Hi there 👋

I'm RaffaDNDM, a Penetration Tester from Italy fallen in love with programming 12 years ago. I always try to automate my penetration testing activities when possible.
I'm developing new tools and extensions to solve every problem that I figure out during my job activities and my life.
